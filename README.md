# Python_german

Well, I'm learning German, and I thought to create a game that could help me do it.

This game is not for german only, it is a free lincense, it is kind of pointless to tell, but it is very easy, but for anyone reading this, go for it, the code, make it yours.

The main thing that I thought, it is how to make the game mine, and want it to grow.

To learn german, I read some materials at internet, and to train I use Lingvist, but decided to code some lines to create something in python.

But enought of that, lets go for the game.

# Purpose of the game.

To "Climb" as highest as possible.

-1 Create a dictionary, containing the words in your mother language (Mine is portugues, but I will use english) as keys.
And as values use the target language, mine is German. Maybe in the future I will use a database, just to be challenging.

-2 You have a limited number of lives, that every time you incorrect type a word you lose.
The number o lives losts, will depend on the floor.
To make things interested I decided to create a "streak" as a bonus for getting right answers in a spaced interval, don't know, maybe 3 or 5, let's see.

-3 Still thinking.
